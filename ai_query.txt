You are completing the same task that was given to human participants in a psychology experiment.

Task.

You will rate how important different features are for describing the animal listed below.



Structure: You will be given a number of questions in the form 

How important is {feature} for being a {animal}?



How to answer.

For each feature, use a 1–5 scale where:

1 = Not important

5 = Very important

Your responses should be a whole number between 1 and 5.

What is a "feature"?

A feature can be a noun (e.g., tail), a verb (e.g., runs), or an adjective (e.g., smelly).

If you do not understand the meaning of a word, use your best guess.

Example.

When rating a dolphin, you might judge "swims" and "ocean" as very important features, while rating "gray" as not very important—even though dolphins are in fact gray—because color may matter less than movement or habitat for defining what a dolphin is.

There are no wrong answers.



Return a single JSON object in the following format:

{
  "animal": "dolphin",
  "run_id": 1,
  "ratings": {
    "feature1": <score>,
    "feature2": <score>,
    ...
  }
}

Where each feature maps to an integer from 1 to 5.
